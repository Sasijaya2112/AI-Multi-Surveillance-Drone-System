# AI-Multi-Surveillance-Drone-System
Every drone has its own purpose. Drones such as agricultural drone can be implemented  only for agriculture, industrial drone can be implemented only for industrial use, and  some other flaws are there in the usage of these drone.  The main objective of our project is to implement a drone which can work for both  agriculture and as well as industrial use. The instruments required for different purposes  can be designed in such a way that it can be altered by just flipping the required sensor  or instrument payload into it. So now, the drone design may be a universal design for  various purposes implemented using the technic which may be termed by us as ‘flipping  instrument system management or FISM’
